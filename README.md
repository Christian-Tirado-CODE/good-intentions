# Virtual Hackathon 2020

## What's this about?
The organization called "Sembrando Sentido" hosted a virtual hackathon with the sole purpose of creating a social network(or parts of it) for non-profits.My friend and I worked on two things we thought were important. We decided to focus on the front-end and build two features using React.js and Firebase.
