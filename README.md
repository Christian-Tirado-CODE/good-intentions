# Virtual Hackathon 2020

The organization called "Sembrando Sentido" hosted a virtual hackathon with the sole purpose of creating a social network(or parts of it) for non-profits. My friend and I worked on two things we thought were important. We decided to focus on the front-end and build two features using React.js and Firebase.

## The two features we built...

The first task we wanted to address was a search bar that allows individuals to look up non-profits based on topics  they are interested in(politics, government, environment etc.) and provide suggestions.

The second page we worked on was the organization's profile. The goal was to design a beautiful interface that would inform users of the following: mission, vision, purpose, posts and events.

## How well did we do?
We managed to get in 2nd place! The judges were impressed with the quality of design and the tasks finished even though we chose to build using a challenging framework.

## Future Plans
The plan is to build a complete and fully functional application using the MERN stack. This project will be split into two phases: the first phase is to build the front-end using React and other handful tools, the second phase is to integrate a customized back-end along with a database using Node.js and MongoDB.
